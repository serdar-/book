==================
Getting started
==================

---------------
Preliminaries
---------------

Very basic computer skills are handy, you need to know how to download and install a software into your computer.

You do not need to have any prior programming experience. You might need some basic algebra and statistics.
Some background in linear algebra and calculus might be useful as well however, I will try to give all the background
information when necessary. Let's get started!

---------------------------------
Installing the necessary software
---------------------------------

We are going to use Python and we are going to need some other packages with it. As the name states, packages include
previously written code (that is packed together) of which we are going to make use of. My reccomendation is for you to
install Anaconda distribution of Python. You can download it from `this webpage. <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_
You should download the Python 2.7 version available for your system. Follow the steps that are suggested on the webpage for
the installation.

After installation, there are a few ways to write and run our code. My suggestion is to use `Jupyter Notebook. <http://http://jupyter.org/>`_
Jupyter Notebook, is a kind kind of server that runs on your computer locally. It opens a web page on your browser, so that you can write and run
your code in your browser and see the output. It also allows you to plot your data at the same page. You can also save all your data along with your
code, therefore it is very useful.
