In the land of data
-------------------

We are ruthlessly creating data. As our capabilities increase and as our devices
get more sophisticated, we continue to produce data faster. In 2013,
`it was suggested that 90% of all world's data had been created within last two years. <http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/05/130522085217.htm>`_
As our devices and capabilities increase, we tend to measure more and get more
data. All this is of course not for nothing.

As there is a surplus of meaningless data, there is demand for meaningful data,
because out of the meaningful data we create knowledge.
According to `this article of The Economist <http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21694990-old-fashioned-ways-reporting-new-discoveries-are-holding-back-medical-research>`_,
a scientific article that was published 30 years ago in
*PNAS (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences)*
had required quarter to half of the data that it would require today. You could
also guess that the number of publications is much higher in comparison to 30 years
ago. In the end we just end up with more and more data.

----------
Analyze
----------

Important part is to get what we want out of all this data. We need to analyze
the data, in order to obtain what we want from it. There are a myriad of software tools for
analyzing data. *Microsoft Excel* is one of the most famous tools that is being
used in this regard. It is intuitive and since it involves a lot of point and click
it is quite easy to use for daily tasks. However, a lot of people
use it under its potential capabilities, which involves quite a number of advanced
functionality. In order to use it to its full potential, one would need to have some
knowledge in (*VBA, Visual Basic for Applications*) programming which could be cumbersome
to learn.

Throughout the years, some programming languages such as R, MATLAB and Python have become more
recognized as data analysis tools. Even the people who did not have any idea about
programming, started to use these tools and actually learned programming. I am one of these people.

Programming
-----------

I had very little knowledge about programming which I acquired during a basic IT course in college.
During my time in college, I did the same thing that everybody did for homeworks and assignments,
I used Excel for my calculations. When I became a senior student, problems that I had to deal with
became more complicated. I needed a more advanced tool, then I started to use MATLAB. As I was dealing
only with numbers, MATLAB was a quite suitable for me. In graduate school, I had to analyze both numbers and
text in huge amounts. Earlier I have had heard about Python but did not really use it. I thought maybe
this is the time that I have to give Python a chance. Ever since, it has been my favorite programming
language both for data analysis and it has never let me down.

That is correct, I am talking about programming. I am not a computer science major and I was not tought
all that computer science mumbo jumbo. For me, it was a rather painful process to learn about programming.
I had to Google the the things that I did not know about, after reading the explanations, I had to do another
search in order to understand all the words in those explanations; browsing and asking questions in forums,
reading blogs, books...

Eventually, I reached to a level where I can analyze my data and solve my problems mostly with a few lines of code,
using some wonderful modules available in Python.

---------------------
Sharing the knowledge
---------------------

Origins of almost all the essential knowledge that I have in Python programming, lay in `StackOverflow <http://www.stackoverflow.com>`_
and in blogs of generous programmers. Just like them, I will try to share all my knowledge in data analysis and Python programming with
this book. I will try to explain everything in the most simple sence and I will avoid using complex terms.
